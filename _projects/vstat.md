I've created a script that is intended for Linux administrators to manage and pull out important information about their Linux deployments. Running this script will present the user with helpful and important system information. This script makes use of utilites that should already be present on a most Linux distributions. This script has been tested on a Ubuntu-based distribution and should work with most flavours of Linux which are similar to Ubuntu.

The script provides a menu interface for the user, where they can select each function using numbers on their keyboard. This script was created to work as a piece of training material for the BASH programming language for me.
