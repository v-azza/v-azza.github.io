Welcome to my personal website. 

I am a Security Operations Analyst working for a market leader in Performing Rights Management, based in the United Kingdom.

I've worked in Cyber Security for more than 7 years and I bring together a wealth of experience from a huge range of sectors into the work I do everyday. 

Beyond my technical work, I’m passionate about the outdoors. Whether I’m hiking, running or working on hands-on DIY projects, I love staying active and embracing new challenges. Jiu Jitsu keeps me moving and engaged in friendly competition.
