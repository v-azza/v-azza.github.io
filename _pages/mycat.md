    <b>Left:</b> This is my cat, Iana. Albeit in a smaller and younger variant - she was brought into this world in May 2020. As you can see, she was very small. In this picture she is processing a thought about tuna she had in the morning. She currently has two neurons in her brain in total.
    <br><br>
    <b>Right:</b> Iana has grown now. Her upkeep was in question so she went to the job centre and got a job as a Chief Mauser. In this picture she has just come home from work and she is ready to wind down.

    <b>Left:</b> Due to a high-paced and stressful work environment, she had to leave her job. Sometimes Iana's responsibilities become too much and it's a bit overwhelming for her. After much deliberation she had decided to work from home permanently. She is a champion in flexible working. Her new job is being the chief mauser in my home. She will likely have this job for the forseeable future and she loves it. In this picture she is sleeping after a long day's work.
    <br><br>
    <b>Right:</b> As we all know, cats like warm places. The top of my computer has become the place for her to get that. In the colder months, she can also be seen glued to the radiator. In this picture she is nonchalantly laying in her favourite warm spot. At least she isn't laying on my keyboard.

    <b>Left:</b> Sometimes we all ponder what our place is in life. Iana is no different. From her spot in the clouds, she can watch over all of the people and birds that make their way into her view. In this picture she is thinking about what life would be like as an outdoor cat.
    <br><br>
    <b>Right:</b> When life gets too intense and overwhelming we all feel emotions of reclusiveness. Some of use deal with that intensity by taking a bath, or going to the pub, or even telling a loved one about their qualms. Iana chooses to hide. From life. In this picture she has concealed herself with the dirty clothes bin. She has likely done this because she saw a dog.
