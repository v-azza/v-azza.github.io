## [vibes+lofi](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0Wmwv2CYB0Qqo2aMbQbZzB?si=ab940b3844164a12)
I like to listen to Lofi when I am programming mostly. I also like to listen to this music when I needing to concentrate on something, given that this playlist is mostly instrumental.

## [stuff](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0uz554cDJDvguSWdq11DfO?si=10d41f57144a4b4d)
A mishmash of mostly rock music that I like to listen to when I am working with my hands. I usually listen to this when I am working on my electronics projects, or cleaning my car.
